This is the project folder for concurency program for PA1
The test.txt file provided here is used for creating graph

I ran the test on the file test.txt looking for string pattern "seen" with 1-500 threads
I have shared graph for both 1-50 threads and 1-500 threads

We can see in graph of 1-50 threads that there is a dip in running time as we increase the thread count from 1 and after sometime it keeps
increasing

Minimum running time is found for thread count = 4

Grpah for thread count 1-500 is not that legible to analyze, hence I have shared both 1-50 threads graph and also 1-500 threads graph

**************************************************************************************************************************************

Program search_string runs for 1-500 threads. You can change the threads count by changing
#define MIN_THREAD_CNT	1
#define MAX_THREAD_CNT	500
in the program
